# Bookshelf Oraganizer

The Bookshelf Organizer App allows you to organize your books onto different shelves. You can create a new book with a title and author, and place it onto the shelf or shelves that fits it best. You can also create a new shelf, with a name and a color. I've used the "name" space as a genre label, but you can do whatever you like, such as length or read and not read.
